## Team-Building Elements

This exercise builds team skills through:

### 1. **Collaborative Decision-Making**
Teams must reach consensus on song choice, which lyrics to change, and how to perform it. This requires negotiation, compromise, and respecting different opinions.

### 2. **Role Distribution & Specialization**
Different students can contribute based on their strengths:
- Strong writers handle lyrics
- Musicians play instruments
- Confident performers take lead vocals
- Tech-savvy students manage backing tracks
Everyone finds their place to contribute meaningfully.

### 3. **Shared Creative Risk**
Performing for peers creates vulnerability. Teams must support each other through potential embarrassment, building trust and psychological safety.

### 4. **Time Management Under Pressure**
With limited prep time, teams must organize efficiently, delegate tasks, and stay focused—real workplace skills.

### 5. **Communication Skills**
Teams must articulate ideas, give/receive feedback, and coordinate timing—all essential collaborative skills.

### 6. **Working Through and Appreciating Differences**
Different musical tastes and performance comfort levels require teams to value diverse perspectives and find creative solutions that work for everyone.

### 7. **Low-Stakes Problem Solving**
Teams encounter challenges (wrong lyrics, timing issues, technical problems) and must adapt together in real-time.
