# 🧱 LEGO Algorithm Challenge  
### Substitute Lesson Plan – Software Engineering Lab

**Objective:** SEWD students will practice sequencing, clarity, and communication by writing and executing “algorithms” for building LEGO structures — without seeing the final goal.

---

## 🧠 Overview
Students act as **programmers** and **computers**.  
- **Programmers** write a *build algorithm* for a LEGO structure.  
- **Computers** (another team) follow those steps *exactly as written* — without knowing what they’re building.  
This simulates how computers execute code literally and without context.

## 🕒 Timing

| Phase | Time | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Round 1 | 25–30 min | Write & execute algorithm round 1 |
| Round 2 | 25–30 min | Write & execute algorithm round 2 |
| Scoring & Reflection | 15–20 min | Discuss results and lessons learned |

---

## 👥 Setup
1. Divide students into **5 teams** of 3 members.  
2. The teacher (or sub) can assign one **Judge** (can rotate, or the teacher can act as judge).  
3. Each round, give each team:  
   - A **small pile of mixed LEGO bricks** (8-10 pieces)  
   - 1 blank sheet of paper  
   - 1 pencil or pen

## 🧩 Rules
1. Each team creates two lego structures AND selects lego pieces of the exact same kind so that another team can replicate it using an algorithm.  These finished structures will be accompanied with the written algorithm.

   - Each model should be simple and must include 8-10 pieces (no more, no less).  
2. Programmers must write two **algorithms** for two builds — a step-by-step list of build instructions.  
   - Use descriptions like “2x4 brick,” “place horizontally,” “stack centered on top.”  
   - **Do not** use colors or drawings.
   -Label the algorithm sheet with your team name.  
3. When done, the teams provide the  **Judge** with both builds AND the algorithm for each build.  The judge should have **10 sets of builds and algorithms, along with the pieces to recreate the build**  
4. Then, one by one, the **Executor Teams** will follows the algorithm *exactly as written*.  
   - No guessing, clarifying, or improvising allowed.  
5. When finished, the **Judge compares** the new build to the original model and scores it using the rubric below.

## ⚖️ Scoring Rubric (15 Points Total)

| Category | Points | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Clarity** | 0–5 | Steps are logical and unambiguous. |
| **Accuracy** | 0–5 | Replica closely matches the original model. |
| **Efficiency** | 0–3 | Instructions are concise and avoid redundancy. |
| **Teamwork / Creativity** | 0–2 | Team collaborates effectively and writes creatively structured steps. |
| **Time to Complete** | 1-10 | Fastest score at the end gets 10 pts, lowest gets 1 point, etc. |

**BOTH TEAMS GET THE SAME SCORE** - this tests the algorithm quality and the computing quality. 

---

## 🧱 Model Guidelines
Keep builds **simple and neutral** (no color clues).  
Use only shape, size, and position to describe.
**Again, use 8-10 pieces only.**

---

## 🧭 Judge’s Role
- Enforce no-color and no-drawing rules.  
- Collect algorithms and distribute them to other teams.  
- Record scores and announce winners.

---

## 🏁 Reflection & Discussion
After all rounds:
- What caused miscommunication between teams?  
- What made an algorithm clear or confusing?  
- How does this relate to writing and debugging code?  
- What improvements could be made to your next “algorithm”?

Reward: **Top Algorithmic Builder Team** (highest score) gets bragging rights.

## 🧰 Materials Checklist
- 1 large LEGO bin (mix of shapes/sizes)    
- Blank paper or index cards  
- Pencils or pens  
- Timer or stopwatch  
- Printed scoring rubric (this handout)  

## 🔁 Round Robin Table
Use this table to track which team’s algorithm is used by which executor team.  
Each team should get to both **write** and **execute** at least twice.

| Round | Algorithm From Team | Executed By Team | Build Name / Code | Completed? (Y/N) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Team 1 | Team 3 | Build A | |
| 1 | Team 2 | Team 4 | Build A | |
| 1 | Team 3 | Team 5 | Build A | |
| 1 | Team 4 | Team 2 | Build A | |
| 1 | Team 5 | Team 1 | Build A | |
| 2 | Team 1 | Team 4 | Build B | |
| 2 | Team 2 | Team 5 | Build B | |
| 2 | Team 3 | Team 1 | Build B | |
| 2 | Team 4 | Team 3 | Build B | |
| 2 | Team 5 | Team 2 | Build B | |
