## Important Notes

⚠️ **These assignments are intentionally more time-consuming than attending class.** The best way to learn HTML and CSS is by doing hands-on coding in class with your teacher and classmates.

⚠️ **No AI-generated content allowed.** All work must be your own research and writing. Essays suspected of using AI will receive a zero.

⚠️ **Handwritten requirement is mandatory.** This ensures you've done your own work and discourages shortcuts.

⚠️ **One essay per absence.** Multiple absences = multiple essays.
