## PPT Assignment **Career Spotlight PPT Deck**

You will build a 7–9 slide presentation about **one** career you researched in your earlier project (Tech Careers Research Project). You must **create a small dataset in Excel** (salary or job growth **over time**), build a chart, and **Paste** it into PPT. Tie content to your earlier research on jobs in this field. 

## Deliverables

* **PowerPoint (.pptx)** named `LastName_CareerSpotlight.pptx`
* **Exported PDF** named `LastName_CareerSpotlight.pdf`
* **Excel file** with the chart data named `LastName_CareerData.xlsx`
* Place in your GitHub repo in a folder titled `careerResearchProject` (PPT, PDF, Excel)

8. (You can add slides if needed). **Day-in-the-Life / Tools** or **Interesting Facts** + **References**
